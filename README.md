## Our Audience
At Flatland Church our biggest audience is friends and family members who are disillusioned by church and religion.
Our goal for people is to see them move closer to the center of God's kingdom, and in turn be a place that is filled with people that are filled with the Holy Spirit.
Within Digital Communications we have identified 3 core audiences that we serve with content and marketing materials. They are *Non-Attenders*, *Attenders*, *Volunteers*. Within each audience are different segments that are likely shared across one another, such as parents with children, single professionals, stay-at-home moms, etc. Our goal in marketing and communicating to each of these audiences is to move them to the next audience column. 

### Non-Attenders
A Non-Attender is someone who has never visited Flatland before, or who never went beyond Attender and has not been to Flatland in months or years.
Our primary conversion goal with a Non-Attender is to get them to attend and become a regular attender.
Primary outreach for Non-Attenders will be via Facebook and Instagram Ads, lead magnets, and email campaigns.

### Attenders
An Attender is someone who attends Flatland consistently, but is not plugged into any ministry at a volunteer level and is not giving at a tithe level.
While the bulk of this audience is cared for by the Discipleship function, we want to be working to use our resources to help Attenders become volunteers.
Our goal for this audience is to inspire them to give more of both their time and their resources to the ministry.
Primary outreach for Attenders is through in-service content, organic social media posts, blog content, and podcast content. We also want to harness email marketing to move the needle in different areas of an attender's walk (coaching, giving, classes, etc.).

### Volunteers
A Volunteer is someone who attends Flatland regularly, is involved in at least one ministry, and is giving regularly. Our primary goal for a volunteer is that they are maintaining their "volunteer" status. This means that they will receive infrequent direct outreach from digital communications as we expect they will already be receiving regular updates from their ministry team leaders.
Most outreach will be in the form of email reminders to hit the yearly goals for an attender and volunteer.
