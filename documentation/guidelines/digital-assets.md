# Photos and Assets Process

In an effort to streamline our photography pipeline and develop the most collaborative process possible, this document outlines the steps and structure that ought to be taken with respect to all photos and digital assets.

## Capturing Moments
Photographs and video taken during Flatland Worship Experiences and Events should serve to highlight people engaging in one of our core values more so than the event itself.
Photos and video should feel both bright and intimate. Interactions in the lobby ought to be favored over instruments on stage.
In effort to make moments feel more intimate and focused on the people, use of a shallow depth of field is also recommended.

### Key Practices
- Show **diversity** of age, gender, and race
- Make the viewer a **participant**, not an observer
- Depict real people in **authentic** moments
- Shoot in natural light
- Create depth in every shot
- Include shots with empty space for text
- Use video to show action or anticipation, not scenery
- Capture emotion (faces, not hands)
- Focus on the celebration (hugs after baptism)
- Shoot a **hero angle** of the speaker

These standards and practices will be expanded as we develop our Brand Guidelines.

## Saving Photos and Videos
Often the need for photos and videos is based on setting and to a lesser extent, an event.

The root of the shared directory should be divided into three folders `photos`, `videos`, and `projects` (see diagram below for full folder structure).

Videos and Photos are for b-roll and general photography, that is, photos and videos we can use for general social media, website, and event promotion. 
Within these folders should be subfolders by location, such as `lobby`, `worship`, `outside`, etc. This makes searching for a photo based on the given need much easier than digging through event or date specific folders. For easy sorting ordering it is best that photos and videos be named based on the date and time taken in the format `201710110930.jpg`.

More specific photos that would be used to advertise specific events such as the chili cookoff, mothers day photo booth, camps, etc. should be placed in the `events` folder and subdivided by event within. Discretion should be used in determining whether a photo taken at an event (such as people mingling in the lobby) expressly depicts the event itself or not. If it does not, it should be placed in the corresponding location folder regardless of the time of its taking.

Finally special consideration should be given to photos of children. While no policy currently exists for the use of photos of children, care should be given to the handling of such photos. While photos of kids engaging in church activities and events are encouraged, they should be separated from the pack and put in the `kids` folder. This way should we develop a policy for asking for releases for publishing photos of children we will have them all in one place for reference, along with a release file that clearly states what platform an image can be published on.

The release file then would look like this:
```
20170916103400.jpg - social,web,in-service
20170916103500.jpg - in-service
20171020093000.jpg - web,in-service
```

```

## Building Projects
You will note in the folder structure above that there is a folder called `projects`. This folder is unique in that it houses all project assets for series-based graphics packs as well as events-based graphics packs. While it is not mandatory that every element of a given project be shared with the team (such as source video clips, stock photos, etc) it is high encouraged that if a project folder is shared, it be done with the below structure for ease of navigation and reuse.

At a minimum, a project folder should contain a `__final` folder that includes `slide_main.png` and `slide_blank.png` (for series), `slide_announcement.png` (for event), `poster.png`, `social.png`, `social_template.png` (optional), `bumper.mp4`, and a `spec.txt` file which serves as a mini brand guideline for the given project.

## Closing Thoughts
Maintaining a unified project structure across all of our projects and digital assets helps us create clear communication protocols and fosters trust and collaboration across the team. It also greatly increases the speed of workflow as assets and final products are quickly accesible to all members of the team. Finally adhering to a strict project workflow ensures that onboarding new team members is smooth and well-documented.
